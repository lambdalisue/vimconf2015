# Gita commit ?

- It open a commit buffer which stands for writing a commit message<br>
  *An alternative of `Gcommit` of fugitive*

- Call `Gita commit` or hit `cc`, `cA`, or `cC` in staging buffer<br>
  *`cc`, `cA`, `cC` stand for `Gita commit`, `Gita commit --amend`, `Gita commit --no-amend` respectively*

- You can temporary save the message with `:w` and commit the changes with `:q` or `CC`<br>
  *The keys are similar to `Gcommit` of fugitive*
