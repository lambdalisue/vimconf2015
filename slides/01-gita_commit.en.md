# Gita commit ?

- call `Gita commit` or hit `cc`, `cA`, or `cC` in staging buffer<br>
  .subtle[`cc`, `cA`, `cC` stand for `Gita commit`, `Gita commit --amend`, `Gita commit --no-amend` respectively]

- Moved from `Gita status` without pain<br>
  .subtle[`cc` keep options until commit, mean that after opening the commit buffer with 'ammend' option, it always open the commit buffer with 'ammend' option]

- You can temporary save the message with `:w` and commit the changes with `:q` or `CC`<br>
  .subtle[The keys are similar to `Gcommit` of fugitive]
